<h1><center>Simple & Multiple & Polynomial Linear Regressions</center></h1>
In this notebook, we learn how to use scikit-learn to implement simple & Multiple & Polynomial linear regressions to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, 
create a model using training set, evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.
