<h1><center>Simple Linear Regression</center></h1>
In this notebook, we learn how to use scikit-learn to implement simple linear regression to fuel consumption and 
Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, 
create a model using training set, evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.
