## Consumer-oriented Machine Learning Porjects

#### Simple & Multiple & Polynomial Regressions on Fuel Consumption
Implement simple, multiple, and polynomial linear regressions to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars;
split fuel consumption data into training and test sets, create models using training set;
evaluate the models using test set by metrics including Mean absolute error (MAE), Residual sum of squares (MSE) and R2-score; and finally to predict unknown value

#### KNN on Telecommunications Customer Classification
Create a KNN model for a telecommunication company,to predict group membership using demographic data, predict, for the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers

#### Logistic Regression on Customer Churn
Create a LR model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor;
measure the accuracy by jaccard and log loss

## Healthcare Industry Machine Learning Projects

#### Decision Trees on Patients' Drug Classification
build a decision tree model from historical data of patients; 
use the trained model to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patients

#### SVM on Cancer Classification
Use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records;
classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant; use metrics like f1 score and jaccard
